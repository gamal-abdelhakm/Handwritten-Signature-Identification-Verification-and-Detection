# Handwritten-Signature-Identification-Verification-and-Detection
The Handwritten Signature Identification and Verification model is a machine learning model that is trained to identify and verify a person's signature from a scanned image or a digital version of it. The model is built using a combination of techniques from computer vision and machine learning.

The process of building the model typically starts with collecting a large dataset of images of handwritten signatures, along with their labels (e.g. genuine or forged signature). These images are then pre-processed and augmented to increase the diversity of the dataset.

First, the model uses a Bag of Words (BoW) algorithm to extract features from the signature images, this algorithm converts the image into a histogram of visual words, then these histograms are used to train a classifier.

Next, a Siamese network is used for signature verification, this network takes two images of signatures as input, and it compares the similarity between them. Siamese networks are useful in this scenario because they can learn a similarity function that can compare two images regardless of their position, orientation, and size.

Finally, a YOLO network is used for signature detection, this network can locate the signature in an image and draw a bounding box around it. YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that is fast and accurate, which makes it suitable for this task.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to identify, verify and detect new signatures, it can differentiate between genuine and forged signatures with a high degree of accuracy. This technology can be used for various applications such as bank transactions, legal documents, and more.
